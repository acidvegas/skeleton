## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) *(**Note:** This script was developed to be used with the latest version of Python)*
* [PySocks](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySocks) *(**Optional:** For using the `proxy` setting)*

## Information
The repository comes with 2 skeletons. A simple, single-file skeleton for basic bots & an advanced structured skeleton for more complex bots.

This is just a basic structure to help setup a bot. The bots have no use by default. It is asyncronous, can log to file, handle basic I/O, flood control, etc.
